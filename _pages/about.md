I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). I received my Ph.D. in 2024 from BUPT. My research interests include federated unlearning, blockchain, and data governance. I have published papers in leading venues such as IEEE TCOM, TSC, TNSE, WWW, and IJCAI. My work has been recognized with several awards, including Second Prizes for Scientific and Technological Process, Best Paper Awards from IEEE OJCS, IEEE IWCMC and IEEE-CCF Service Computing Committee, as well as top prizes in national blockchain innovation competitions. In 2024, I was selected for China’s Postdoctoral Innovative Talent Support Program, one of the most competitive national fellowships, with only 24 awardees selected nationwide in my field. I really enjoy exchanging ideas and collaborating on challenging problems. Please feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration or just want to connect.

Teaching
======
In accordance with university policy, postdoctoral researchers are not permitted to teach courses.

Collaboration
======
Although I currently do not hold independent supervision quotas as a postdoctoral researcher, I’m open to co-advising students (undergraduate or graduate) in collaboration with faculty members. I welcome collaborative thesis projects, internships, and exploratory research discussions — especially with curious minds who enjoy building, breaking, and improving things. If you're interested in research topics like federated unlearning, blockchain, trustworthy AI, or data governance, feel free to reach out. 

Let’s go! Time to clock out and have some fun!

I believe in reading more, moving more, and seeing more — whether it's papers, people, mountains, or oceans.
