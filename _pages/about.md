Teaching
======
In accordance with university policy, postdoctoral researchers are not permitted to teach courses.

Collaboration
======
Although I currently do not hold independent supervision quotas as a postdoctoral researcher, I’m open to co-advising students (undergraduate or graduate) in collaboration with faculty members. I welcome collaborative thesis projects, internships, and exploratory research discussions — especially with curious minds who enjoy building, breaking, and improving things. If you're interested in research topics like federated unlearning, blockchain, trustworthy AI, or data governance, feel free to reach out. 

Let’s go! Time to clock out and have some fun!
======

I believe in reading more, moving more, and seeing more — whether it's papers, people, mountains, or oceans.
